- Coding challenges:
    - Create a class that will implement your own version of a LinkedList
    (Java collection where elements are stored as nodes, each node contains a link to the next node, 
    and whatever data you wish to hold, let's say a string value) without using any Java collection classes
    - Write a method that will take in an int (whole number base 10) and return its hexadecimal value (whole number base 16)
*/
